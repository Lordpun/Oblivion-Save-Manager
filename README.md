# Oblivion Save Manager
### (OSM for short)

This is a tool for managing character saves in original The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

This was based on a tool on Nexus (I belive it was [Oblivion Savegame Manager by Askedal](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/47845))
I simply couldn't get Wine working, so out of bordem I remade it my self.

## Note
This tool is still in development. There isn't much here yet.
Also currently planned as Linux only as I develop this 
(If you wish to fix it, I belive the only issue is just simply the config file path)

## Features
### In development as mentioned, so none of these are here currently.
* Sorts your saves into folders by character (Not implemented yet)
* Allows you to add or remove characters (Not implemented yet)
* Gives a summary of your character and their most recent save (Not implemented yet)

## Dependencies
* TES IV: Oblivion (For fairly obvious reasons)
* GTKmm 4.0 (Only for if complining yourself I believe, probably won't need it if you're using the precompiled file)
* Currently Linux only (I'll add support for Windows and Mac later)
	(I'm assuming that's all I need to do, I'm not too knowledgable on OS specific issues)

## Disclaimer
After I finish this tool, I probably won't maintain it too much unless issues personally affect me.
I intend for this more as a personal tool and hobby project.
